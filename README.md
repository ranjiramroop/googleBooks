# Google Books Search

## User Story

I want to search for books and save them all in one convenient place, and later delete the books.

## Usage

Type the title of the book you would like to find in the search bar, then click on the Submit Book button.
Books will then display below the search bar that match your search input.
When the book displays, we will see the cover of the book, the title of the book, the author, and a brief summary of the book. The user will also be able to see more details through a link that will bring them to the Google Books site.
When you find the book that you are ready to save, click on the Save button in the top right of the results box.
This Saved button will bring your book to the Saved tab, where you will have the option to Delete the book by clicking on the Delete button.
